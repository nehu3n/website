      <p class="text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400 leading-relaxed">
        I've always had a computer, so since I was ten years old I've been using it extensively. I started to approach programming when I was eleven, watching videos and reading about languages and technologies such as <span class="text-zinc-700 dark:text-zinc-300">Godot</span> or <span class="text-zinc-700 dark:text-zinc-300">JavaScript</span>. My first ‚Äúprojects‚Äù were within the social network Discord, where to practice and continue gaining experience I developed bots for a few years.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Then I discovered other languages like <span class="text-zinc-700 dark:text-zinc-300">Go</span>, <span class="text-zinc-700 dark:text-zinc-300">TypeScript</span>, <span class="text-zinc-700 dark:text-zinc-300">Python</span> and, a little more than a year ago, <span class="text-zinc-700 dark:text-zinc-300">Rust</span>. Also around the age of thirteen I got into web development. I always liked to improve and increase my knowledge, studying a variety of content, from the most theoretical to its practical application. I create software that is useful to me and the influenced ecosystem. I am very perfectionist and defender of my position in the opinions I give, although I have no problem to accept if I'm wrong.
