> building fast, quiet systems.

this is the source code for my personal website — a minimalist space for my projects, experiments, and technical writings.

## philosophy

the web should be fast, quiet, and efficient. no bloat, just content and performance. this site follows a strict aesthetic of pure black and zinc tones, focusing on readability and technical clarity.
